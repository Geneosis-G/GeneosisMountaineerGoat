[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This mod was originally called Grapling Hook, but as I made an actual hook for the Rico Rodrigoat mod, I had to think about a better name and context for this mod ^^
The idea behind this mod was to have solid wires that you can attach between two pints, then walk on them so I started making the solid cables before finding the definitive mod name.
The cables have the same visual as the hooks used by Rico Rodrigoat, but this time I had to give them proper collisions to make it possible for the goat to ride them. I also improved the cable scaling a bit so that both ends of a cable will appear to stick to the surface they are attached to as much as possible. It's still not perfect, but it's better than the hook at least :p
Finally, after playing around with them, I figured out that a Mountaineer would make perfect sense to have the ability to place ropes everywhere! So I tried to find a few outfit parts thay would match this type of character and ended up with a beard and a scarf (no beanie to be found in the game files :/). Sadly, the scarf was glitching out after a few minuted of gameplay and before that it was quite annoying because it was blocking the view, so I decided to remove it.
